OpenGL Living Room Scene

This is a straightforward demonstration of simple lighting applied to furniture in a living room. It was submitted as part of my coursework in CS535 at UK.

The project was created in Visual Studio using C++, and the repository here includes the additional GL libraries needed to run it. To run, simply import the project and build it. Controls for moving the scene to get a better view of things are located at the top of main.cpp.

A quick note: Submission particulars required me to merge all code into a single file, which caused that file to be rather unwieldy.
